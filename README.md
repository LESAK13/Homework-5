# Homework-5

For this homework assignement, it was necessary to code JavaScript to produce a simple daily planner.  

First, using the HTML provided, I set up divs for the time blocks, text areas and save buttons for each time (9am - 6pm).

I then used moment.js to place the current day in the <p> provided under the headings.

When the page loads, local storage used is to retrieve any information previously saved.

Each button, when clicked, saves the value of the text area to local storage.

I was confused by the CSS provided, so I did not utilize it.  I attempted other ways, using the current hour from js.moment to change the colors of the text areas based on the current time, but many different ways did not work.
